# 3D Butterfly Mesh Subdivision #

A Geometric Modelling Assignment from UBC Computer Science, this web app performs 3D mesh subdivision using a Butterfly scheme.  Students were provided a code template, and were responsible for coding the Mesh Class (Mesh.js), the subdivision algo (subdivision.js), the Vector3D class (Vector3D.js), and the mesh object loading/display (main.js)


### Set Up ###

* Download Repo
* Run an HTTP server on localhost using the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the parent repo directory
* Open `localhost:8000` in a web browser window
* Navigate to `app.html`
* Load an object file
* Increase or decrease the number of subdivision levels.  Note that on larger meshes, higher degrees of subdivision will require some time to render inititally, however, the code does save the subdivided meshes after initial rendering.
